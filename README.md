# Learning C#

This repository is my personal code hub for exploring and practicing C# development.

I'm using this repo to organize multiple C# projects in one place. Each project lives in its own folder within the repository. This setup allows me to experiment with different concepts, tools, and applications as I learn and grow my skills with C# and .NET.

## Structure

## Goals

- Practice core C# syntax and features
- Explore .NET tools and libraries
- Build small console apps, APIs, or other C#-based solutions

Feel free to browse around and explore each project folder to see what I'm working on!
